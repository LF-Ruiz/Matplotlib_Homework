I this activity we are doing the visualization of the data analysis

As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. 

The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results. 


Summary:

After cleaning the data, these are the data points for each drug:
Capomulin    230
Ramicane     228
Ketapril     188
Naftisol     186
Zoniferol    182
Placebo      181
Stelasyn     181
Ceftamin     178
Infubinol    178
Propriva     156

There is 50,2% percent of mouse that are Male and 49.8% Female.

Capmulin and Ramicane have the smallest Tumor Volume at Last Timepoint (mm3).

For mouse "B128" we can see a big decrease of tumor volume. But, after 32 days, the tumor starts to grow again.

The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84, so we can tell there is a correlation between the two variables.
